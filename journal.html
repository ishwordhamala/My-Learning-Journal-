      <h3>Week 1</h3>
      <p>This week, I created a <strong>PWA-based Temperature Converter App</strong>. I learned how to use HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript to build a simple web application that can also be installed on a device as a Progressive Web App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Week 2</h3>
      <p>This week, I built my <strong>Learning Journal Website</strong>. I learned about mobile-first design and how
        to structure a multi-page website using HTML and CSS. This journal will record my progress throughout the module.</p>
    </section>

      <h3>Week 3 </h3>
      <p> This wee i learned how to use JavaScript to make my website more dynamic and interactive. I used the features of displaying the current time on the Homepage and another thing I added a new Dark/Light mode toggle that makes my learning Journal really awesome. These small features made the website feel more functional and modern.</p>
      
      
      <h4> Week 4- 12 Coming Soon</h4>
      <p>Each following week, I will continue to add reflections here about the new projects, features, or concepts I
        develop as part of the Mobile Application Development module.</p>
